<h1>Digital Millennium Copyright Act</h1>

<div class="section">
	
	<p>It is our policy to respond to notices of alleged infringement that comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the text of which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office Web Site <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/legislation/dmca.pdf">www.copyright.gov/legislation/dmca.pdf</a>) and other applicable intellectual property laws, which may include removing or disabling access to material claimed to be the subject of infringing activity. If we remove or disable access to comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, we will make a good-faith attempt to contact the user who posted the material so that he or she may make a counter notification pursuant to sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of that Act. It is our policy to document all notices of alleged infringement on which we act. A copy of the notice will be sent to Chilling Effects (<a href="http://www.chillingeffects.org">http://www.chillingeffects.org</a>), which will make it available to the public.</p>
